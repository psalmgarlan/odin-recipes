        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup cold water</li>
                <li>½ cup uncooked long grain white ric</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>    
                <li>16 ounces tomato sauce, divided/li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>   
                <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.</li>
                <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
                <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
                <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
